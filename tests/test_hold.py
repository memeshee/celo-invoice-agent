"""The hold/release path and trust explainability.

Pre-fix a "review" verdict told the user a human would release it and left that
human nothing to act on: no stored ticket, no command, no way to say yes. These
tests pin the ticket lifecycle and the two properties that make it safe — a held
invoice is never payable, and the settlement window starts at release.
