"""JSON invoice store. Single-file, no deps. Fine for hackathon scale.

Security fixes (audit run-1):
- unbound-settlement-proof / settled-receipt-rewrite-on-recheck: the store now
  records the invoice's creation block, keeps a consumed-witness registry so one
  on-chain transfer can settle at most one invoice, and never rewrites a
  settled invoice.
- invoice-lookup-not-scoped-to-requester: ids carry a random suffix, so the
  handle is a capability instead of a guessable counter.

Multi-tenant (Phase 1): each invoice carries its own payout address, and a user
registers the wallet they get paid at. Before this, every invoice paid one
global INVOICE_WALLET, so onboarding a second freelancer — an "independent
user" in the rules — was structurally impossible.
