"""Services the agent buys per invoice — paid calls into systems it does not own.

An invoice agent that only parses text and watches a chain is a script. The
valuable part is what it has to *buy* to let money move: we do not run a
sanctions list, so the agent rents one, per invoice, and the receipt proves it
paid. Roughly $0.009 per invoice across three calls:

- `fx-rate`         ($0.002) independent cross-check of the rate we priced with
- `sanctions-wallet` ($0.002) screen the payout address
- `sanctions-name`  ($0.005) screen the counterparty name

A sanctions hit blocks settlement of that invoice. That is the whole point: the
purchase is not a demo of paying, it is the gate.

Rules that keep this honest:
- The raw response is written to disk BEFORE it is parsed. A lost paid body is
  unrecoverable, and the wallet-keyed receipt endpoints refuse Celo payments.
- Every paid run carries an Idempotency-Key so a retry replays instead of
  charging twice.
- Settlement is verified on-chain (receipt status + a USDC Transfer from our
  payer) instead of trusting the PAYMENT-RESPONSE header, which is just the
  seller's own claim about itself.
- A failed purchase never blocks a mint and never invents a result: the invoice
  records the failure and the page says so.
