"""Autonomous settlement watcher — the part that makes this an agent.

Before this, settlement only happened when a human typed `/check`. That makes
the bot a parser with a cron habit, not an agent: nothing closed the loop on its
own, and a payer who simply sent the money left the invoice dangling.

This loop polls Celo for every open invoice, settles the ones that were paid,
and pushes the receipt to the freelancer.

Why Blockscout and not eth_getLogs: free Celo RPCs cannot serve day-scale log
history (forno rejects topic filters outright, publicnode caps a request at
~3000 blocks, ankr refuses large ranges). A head-relative log window silently
stops finding payments as an invoice ages — the exact failure that makes a
settled invoice read as unpaid.
